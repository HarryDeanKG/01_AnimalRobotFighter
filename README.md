First try and creating a robot fighting game


Inspired by Zoids new century will attempt to make a 1v1 battle simulator with animal robots, piloted by humans, like Zoids. 

Originally I wanted a game where you choose a piolet (or a robot that has some slight controls) and let the game run with no further user input.
This should still be a function of the game as it will control the ai however human input is generally a good option in games. So I have decided to opt for a hybrid. This being: pause/slow the game, give controls to the Zoid, it carries out the actions, pause the game again. At the end of the battle a video will be made available of the game without the pauses. 
The game Battelstar Galactica Deadlock was the inspiration for this idea. Let's see how it pans out.

Steps:
# 01 Generate a basic map
# 02 Generate a basic pawn
# 03 Make a pause screen
# 04 Give pause screen functions
# 04-1 Change colour of a light
# 04-2 Make pawn go forward, left, right

Once we have this covered we can start trying to do more complicated things.

The end result for me would be two Zoids fighting. We will need to give them ranged weapons and melee weapons. And a camera to track the battle.
